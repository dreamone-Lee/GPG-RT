# Source code for GPG-RT
This repo includes the implementation of GPG-RT Algorithm described in the paper *GPG-RT: Generalized Policy Gradient with Real-Time Information for the Stochastic On-Time Arrival Routing Problem*, and the benchmarks, namely [DOT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261520303271), [FMA](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9832008), [OS-MIP](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261515301429), [ILP](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8543229), [GP3](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9522098), [PQL](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8952783), and [CTD](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9497787/) used for comparison.

## Dataset
The network data used for conducting simulations is available at [Networks.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B-NNZ7lxKrulPy6ncVzeusUrocVgUlny/view?usp=drive_link). Please unzip the downloaded file into the same directory of the source code.
The dataset includes 5 networks/time slots. Each of them consists of 3 files:

- `_network.csv`, nodes and links of the network, and mean cost of each link.
- `_OD.csv`, OD pairs of the network in experiments.
- `_sigma.npy`, random sigma generated by mu used in experiments.

## Dependencies
GPG-RT needs those dependencies:

- Python 3.9+
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Pandas

Benchmark needs additional dependencies:

- NetworkX
- gurobipy (a license might be needed)

## Description
The source code includes the following files:
- `GPG_RT.py`, implementation of GPG-RT algorithm.
- `SEGAC_bench`, the folder of benchmark algorithms. You could read more thing in README of benchmark.
